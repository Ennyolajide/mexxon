We no longer live in a world where you can stay in the same job for your entire career, retire and collect your pension. Workers today are constantly faced with corporate restructuring and layoffs, forcing them to face constant change and upheaval.

                            For people who are looking to change jobs or careers attending the Job Skills Training Program at Mexxon will help you tremendously to acquire the skills you require to succeed. Ruth will put you through the benefits of the Program so you understand that there is no better investment you can make for your own future. Why spend years studying to obtain a degree only to fail to secure a good job due to lack of job search skills? Companies are in business to make money and their only loyalty is to the “bottom line”. When their bottom line suffers, they layoff employees and this can happen to anyone at any time. "Job Search is therefore an integral part of modern. Searching for a job today then has become a job in itself that requires specialized training, planning, management and strategies to enable you to conduct your job search successfully.
