                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Searching for a job is an exciting but stressful process. You have big hopes and fears and this can make searching for a job more difficult. It can be the most frustrating thing. You spend hours writing what you think is a great
                        CV, send it off with your fingers crossed and then you wait. And wait. For some reason, your application just did not grab the attention of any of the prospective employers out there. This is where the Mexxon Job Search Skills
                        Training Program comes in.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Our much sought after Training Program consists of Lectures, Inter-active Sessions and Practical Exercises to enable participants to do mock interviews for example and learn how to do them proficiently
                        with us before they have to go and face a real Job Interview Panel.
